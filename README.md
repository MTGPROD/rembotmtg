# Rem Bot

Welcome to the github of the Rem Bot project, if you are maybe it's because you want to help out with the project. 

UPDATE: This project is dead since 2020. I'm maintaining the code to keep it readable so yeah.

# How help

If you really want to contribute to this project you can:

Create an issue if you found a bug or want to make a suggestion. You can also create an issue to make a suggestion.

Create a pull request (in the branch glitch) if you find a bug but have a fix. Or if you have a suggestion with the code ready for use.

# Help me

If you really want to help me for creating **Rem** you need to download this repository as ZIP and lauch it in a IDE (EX: Visual Studio Code)
to submit your work you can create a pull request to discuss about and add it or not.
